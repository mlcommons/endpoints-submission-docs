# Run commands

Runs represent individual benchmark executions. Each run is registered from a local result folder, uploaded as a compressed archive, and given a UUID that can later be referenced in a submission.

---

## runs list

List all runs registered under the authenticated account.

```bash
endpoints-submission-cli runs list [--token TOKEN] [-j]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--token TOKEN` | API key. Falls back to `PRISM_USER_API_TOKEN`. |
| `-j` / `--json` | Print raw JSON instead of the Rich table. |

**Example:**

```bash
endpoints-submission-cli runs list

endpoints-submission-cli runs list -j
```

**Output (table):**

```
 ID                                    Model                             Concurrency  Started At

```

## runs create

Parse a local run folder, register a run record with the API, and upload the folder as a compressed archive (`.tar.gz`).

```bash
endpoints-submission-cli runs create \
  --path PATH \
  [--token TOKEN] \
  [--expires-at DATETIME] \
  [--pinned] \
  [--test] \
  [--dry-run]
```

| Flag | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--path PATH` | yes | Path to the local run folder. |
| `--token TOKEN` | no | API key. |
| `--expires-at DATETIME` | no | Expiry datetime in ISO 8601 format (e.g. `2026-01-01T00:00:00`). Defaults to server policy when omitted. |
| `--pinned` | no | Pin the run immediately to prevent automatic expiry. |
| `--test` | no | Mark the run as a test run so it is excluded from published reporting. Fixed at creation — there is no API to change it later. |
| `--dry-run` | no | Print the parsed API payload as JSON and exit without calling the API. |

A run flagged `--test` shows as `Test Run │ Yes` in `runs get`. It is **not** visible in
`runs list`: that view is served by the API's `RunSummary` schema, which does not carry
`is_test`, so the test marker stays dormant there until the API exposes it.

`submissions create-local --test` sets the same flag on every run it registers, so a test
submission never leaves untagged runs behind. `submissions create` takes already-registered
runs, so flag those at `runs create` time.

**Run folder layout** — the folder must contain:

```
<run-folder>/
├── system_desc.json                  # §8.2 hardware/software description (required)
├── point.yaml                        # §8.3 Pareto-point disclosure (required)
│                                     #   ^ both authored by the submitter, not by endpoints
├── performance/result_summary.json   # Performance metrics (required)
├── accuracy/accuracy_results.json    # Per-dataset accuracy scores
├── config.yaml                       # Resolved benchmark configuration (optional as of v1.0)
├── events.jsonl                      # Per-event log (largest file by far)
├── report.txt                        # Human-readable report
├── sample_idx_map.json               # Sample index mapping
├── metrics/final_snapshot.json       # Metrics snapshot
├── src/<implementation>/             # Merged into the bundle's shared src/ (README.md required)
└── documentation/                    # Merged into the bundle's shared docs/
```

This is the layout `mlcommons/endpoints` writes to its `report_dir` — `performance/`
exists when the performance phase ran, `accuracy/` when the accuracy phase ran, and
`--mode both` produces both. See
[run-folder layout](../reference/run-folder-layout.md) for a captured example. Flat
layouts that put `result_summary.json` at the top level are not accepted by
`runs create`.

`point.yaml` is the required one: it is the §8.3 disclosure the Submission Checker
validates (seeds, warmup counts, data source, region, model and dataset metadata), and it
is copied into the bundle verbatim — the CLI does not derive it from `config.yaml` and
does not fill in missing fields, so whatever the harness emits is what gets submitted.

`config.yaml` became **optional** in v1.0. It records what the harness was told to do and
carries no disclosure of its own; it is still copied through whenever a run supplies it.
The builder needs to know whether a run is an accuracy or a performance run, and it
will not guess. It reads `datasets[].type` from `config.yaml` first, then falls back to
point.yaml's §8.3 `dataset_type` when that is exactly `Accuracy` or `Performance`. If
neither answers — no `config.yaml` and no `dataset_type`, or a `dataset_type` of
`Accuracy + Performance`, which describes the dataset rather than this run — the build
fails with a message naming the run.

That is deliberate. Defaulting to "performance" was silently destructive: an accuracy
run shipped without a `config.yaml` would be filed as its concurrency's performance run,
collide with the real one, and drop its accuracy results from the bundle.

**Rollback behaviour:** if the archive upload fails after the run record has been created, the CLI automatically deletes the run record to leave a clean state. If that delete also fails, the orphaned run ID is printed so it can be cleaned up manually.

**Example:**

```bash
# Register and upload
endpoints-submission-cli runs create --path ./results/llama3_h100_c4

# Preview the payload without calling the API
endpoints-submission-cli runs create --path ./results/llama3_h100_c4 --dry-run

# Register with a custom expiry
endpoints-submission-cli runs create \
  --path ./results/llama3_h100_c4 \
  --expires-at 2026-06-01T00:00:00

# Register and pin immediately
endpoints-submission-cli runs create --path ./results/llama3_h100_c4 --pinned

# Register as a test run, excluded from published reporting
endpoints-submission-cli runs create --path ./results/llama3_h100_c4 --test
```

**Output:**

```
Run created: d5d9873e-5eca-4f8d-a487-4be1cb8b440c
Archive: gs://mlperf-runs/d5d9873e-…/d5d9873e-….tar.gz
```

## runs get

Fetch full details of a single run and optionally download its archive.

```bash
endpoints-submission-cli runs get \
  --run-id RUN_ID \
  [--download-to DIR] \
  [--token TOKEN] \
  [-j|--json]
```

| Flag | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--run-id RUN_ID` | yes | Run UUID. |
| `--download-to DIR` | no | Directory to download the run archive (`.tar.gz`) into. Created automatically if it does not exist. |
| `--token TOKEN` | no | API key. |
| `-j`, `--json` | no | Output the raw API record as JSON instead of the table. |

By default the run is rendered as a table, followed by a **System Info** table. `config` and `result_summary` are nested blobs and are omitted from the table — use `-j/--json` to see them. When `--download-to` is provided, the archive is saved as `<run-id>.tar.gz` inside the specified directory and the saved path is printed afterwards; that message goes to stderr, so `runs get -j` stays pipeable into `jq`.

**Example:**

```bash
# Fetch run details only
endpoints-submission-cli runs get --run-id d5d9873e-5eca-4f8d-a487-4be1cb8b440c

# Raw JSON, including config and result_summary
endpoints-submission-cli runs get --run-id d5d9873e-5eca-4f8d-a487-4be1cb8b440c -j

# Fetch details and download the archive to ./downloads/
endpoints-submission-cli runs get \
  --run-id d5d9873e-5eca-4f8d-a487-4be1cb8b440c \
  --download-to ./downloads
```

**Output (with `--download-to`):**

```

```

`submissions get` marks a flagged run with a yellow `*` before the model name in its embedded
runs table, with a `* = test run` legend beneath. `runs list` cannot show this yet — its
`RunSummary` payload omits `is_test`.

---

## runs delete

Delete a run record and its stored archive.

```bash
endpoints-submission-cli runs delete \
  --run-id RUN_ID \
  [--token TOKEN]
```

| Flag | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--run-id RUN_ID` | yes | Run UUID. |
| `--token TOKEN` | no | API key. |

> **Note:** Runs that belong to an active submission cannot be deleted. Withdraw the submission first (`submissions withdraw`), then delete the run.

**Order of operations:** archive is deleted from storage first (best-effort; a 404 is silently ignored), then the run record is deleted from the database.

**Example:**

```bash
endpoints-submission-cli runs delete --run-id d5d9873e-5eca-4f8d-a487-4be1cb8b440c
```

---

## runs pin

Pin a run to prevent automatic expiry (`expires_at` is set to `null`).

```bash
endpoints-submission-cli runs pin \
  --run-id RUN_ID \
  [--token TOKEN]
```

| Flag | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--run-id RUN_ID` | yes | Run UUID. |
| `--token TOKEN` | no | API key. |

**Example:**

```bash
endpoints-submission-cli runs pin --run-id d5d9873e-5eca-4f8d-a487-4be1cb8b440c
# → Run pinned: d5d9873e-5eca-4f8d-a487-4be1cb8b440c
```

---

## runs unpin

Restore normal expiry behaviour on a pinned run.

```bash
endpoints-submission-cli runs unpin \
  --run-id RUN_ID \
  [--token TOKEN]
```

| Flag | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--run-id RUN_ID` | yes | Run UUID. |
| `--token TOKEN` | no | API key. |

**Example:**

```bash
endpoints-submission-cli runs unpin --run-id d5d9873e-5eca-4f8d-a487-4be1cb8b440c
# → Run unpinned: d5d9873e-5eca-4f8d-a487-4be1cb8b440c
```
